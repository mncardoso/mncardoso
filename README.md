### Hi there 👋

I'm Miguel, a 🧑‍💻front-end developer with an analytical eye for details and design. I have experience in designing, coding and testing front-end web applications in various programming languages and frameworks. I specialise in JavaScript and have professional experience working with React, Node and Next. I love solving problems and keeping up with the latest features of the technologies in my field. I can easily adapt my workflow to new frameworks, test on different platforms and integrate a team either remotely or at the office, anywhere in the world. I'm bilingual in Portuguese and English, and speak fairly well Spanish and French.
