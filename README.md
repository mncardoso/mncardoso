### Hi there 👋

I’m Miguel Cardoso, a coder🧑‍💻/designer🧑‍🎨 that loves to solve problems. With an analytical eye for details, I always brings growth to my employers. I have a wide range of knowledge within the tools used for visual design, video and audio production, 3D environments, video-games, web-design and interactivity. As an eager learner, I complement knowledge with his own experiences. I can easily integrate a team, working remotely or at the office. Having worked in the hospitality industry helped I understand people’s needs and how to manage a team, bringing out the best of each person. I also love keeping up with the latest technologies and finding out what I can do with the new features. You will be able to communicate with me in Portuguese, English and Spanish (and in some more languages in the future).
