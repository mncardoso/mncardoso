### Hi there 👋

Hi, I’m Miguel Cardoso, a coder🧑‍💻/designer🧑‍🎨 that loves solving problems. With an analytical eye for details, I bring growth to my employers. I use a wide range of software for visual design, video and audio production, 3D environments, video-games, web-design and interactivity. I love keeping up with the latest features of the technologies in my field. I can easily integrate a team, either working remotely or at the office, anywhere in the world. I also have experience in team management, bringing out the best of each person. I’m bilingual in Portuguese and English, and I speak fairly well Spanish and French.
